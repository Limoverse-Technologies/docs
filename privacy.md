**HOW DO WE PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION?**

At Limoverse, we implement a multi-layered approach to safeguard your personal data:

1. Data Storage and Isolation:
   We store application data in a dedicated, isolated database system. This database is designed to exclude Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and personal identification details, minimising potential exposure. The database operates in a fully isolated environment with no external network connectivity, significantly reducing the risk of unauthorised access.

2. Access Control:
   Access to the database is restricted exclusively to our application through robust authentication mechanisms. We employ industry-standard password hashing algorithms and enforce strict password policies to prevent unauthorised access attempts.

3. Data Encryption:
   All data transmitted between our front-end applications and backend servers is encrypted using TLS 1.3 protocol. This ensures that information in transit is protected from interception and tampering.

4. API Security:
   We utilise JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for API communication. JWTs provide a secure method of transmitting information between parties as a JSON object, ensuring the integrity and authenticity of the data exchanged.

5. User Authentication:
   Our user authentication system employs multi-factor authentication options and session management to verify user identity and maintain secure connections throughout user interactions with our platform.

6. Regular Security Audits:
   We conduct periodic security assessments and penetration testing to identify and address potential vulnerabilities in our systems.

7. Employee Access Controls:
   We maintain strict access controls and data handling procedures for our employees, ensuring that only authorised personnel can access sensitive information on a need-to-know basis.

8. Incident Response:
   We have a comprehensive incident response plan in place to quickly address and mitigate any potential security breaches.

9. Data Minimisation:
   We collect and retain only the information necessary for the purposes identified in this privacy policy.

10. Physical Security:
    Our servers and offices are protected by appropriate physical security measures.

While we implement these rigorous security measures, it's important to note that no system connected to the internet can guarantee 100% security. We encourage users to take personal responsibility for their account security by:

1. Using strong, unique passwords for their Limoverse account
2. Enabling multi-factor authentication when available
3. Avoiding sharing account credentials
4. Reporting any suspicious activity or potential security breaches immediately

By combining our robust security infrastructure with user vigilance, we strive to create a secure environment for all Limoverse users.

**WHERE DO WE STORE/TRANSFER YOUR INFORMATION?**

Personal information held by Limoverse is stored on and processed on computers situated in the UAE, India, and other jurisdictions. We and/or our service providers also process data in some other countries for customer care, account management, and service provisioning.

By using our services, you authorise the transfer of your information to the UAE, where we are based, and to other locations including India, where we and/or our service providers operate, and to its (and their) storage and use as specified in this Privacy Policy and any applicable terms of service or other agreement between you and Limoverse.

In some cases, Limoverse may seek specific consent for the use or transfer of your information overseas at the time of collection. If you do not consent, we may be unable to provide you with the services you requested. The countries where we operate may not have protections for personal information equivalent to those in your home country.

International transfers within Limoverse and its corporate affiliates:
To facilitate our global operations, we transfer information among our corporate affiliates in countries whose privacy and data protection laws may not be as robust as the laws of the countries where our customers and users are based.

International transfers to third parties:
Some of the third parties described in this Privacy Policy, which provide services to us under contract, are based in other countries that may not have equivalent privacy and data protection laws to the country in which you reside. When we share information with such third parties, we shall make use of legally recognized data transfer mechanisms, binding corporate rules for transfers to data processors, or other appropriate legal mechanisms to safeguard the transfer.

**HOW LONG DO WE STORE YOUR INFORMATION?**

We store your information until it is no longer necessary to provide the services or otherwise relevant for the purposes for which it was collected. This time period may vary depending on the type of information and the services used, as detailed below. After such time, we will either delete or anonymize your information or, if this is not possible (for example, because the information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your information and isolate it from any further use until deletion is possible.

We may also retain aggregate information beyond this time for research purposes and to help us develop and improve our services. You cannot be identified from anonymized information retained or used for these purposes.

1. Customer account information:
   We store your account information for as long as your account is active and a reasonable period thereafter in case you decide to re-activate the services. We also retain some of your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, enforce our agreements, support business operations, and continue to develop and improve our services.

2. Communications usage information:
   While you're an active customer, we retain the communications usage information generated by your use of the services until the information is no longer necessary to provide our services, and for a reasonable time thereafter as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, to resolve disputes, to enforce our agreements, to support business operations, and to continue to develop and improve our services.

3. Marketing information, cookies and web beacons:
   If you have elected to receive marketing emails from us, we retain information about your marketing preferences for a reasonable period of time from the date you last expressed interest in our services, such as when you last opened an email from us or visited our websites. We retain information derived from cookies and other tracking technologies for a reasonable period of time from the date such information was created.

4. Device information:
   We collect device-specific information from you when we have provided end-user equipment to you or you have installed our software on your device. If you do not revoke our access to this information via the privacy settings on your device, we will retain this information for as long as your account is active.

5. Health and fitness data collected through Health Connect:
   This data is retained for up to seven years after your Limoverse account turns inactive or until you revoke access, whichever comes first.

6. Genetic and Phenotypic Information:
   This information is stored indefinitely on our blockchain platform, as it is considered proprietary to you. You have the right to request its deletion at any time.

**HOW TO ACCESS AND CONTROL YOUR INFORMATION?**

Please note that certain data associated with that account may nonetheless remain on Limoverse's servers in an aggregated or anonymized form that does not specifically identify you. Similarly, data associated with your account that we are required by law to maintain will also not be deleted.

   You may opt out of receiving promotional communications from us by using the unsubscribe link within each email, updating your email preferences within your Service account settings menu, or by contacting us as provided below to have your contact information removed from our promotional email list or registration database.

   1. The right to access personal information we hold about you
   2. The right to request correction or deletion of your personal information
