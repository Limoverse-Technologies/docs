This Cookies and Tracking Notice ("Notice") explains how Limoverse Technologies LLC ("Limoverse," "we," "our," or "us") uses cookies and similar technologies to recognise you when you visit our websites, use our mobile applications, or interact with our services (collectively, "Services"). It explains what these technologies are and why we use them, as well as your rights to control our use of them.

**WHAT ARE COOKIES?**
A cookie is a small text file that a website saves on your computer or mobile device when you visit the site. Cookies allow the website to remember your actions and preferences (such as login, language, font size and other display preferences) over a period of time, so you don't have to keep re-entering them whenever you come back to the site or browse from one page to another.

**TYPES OF COOKIES AND TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES WE USE**
We and our service providers may use the following types of cookies and tracking technologies:

1. Essential Cookies: These cookies are strictly necessary to provide you with our Services. They enable core functionality such as security, network management, and accessibility. You may not opt-out of these cookies as the Services would not function properly without them.
2. Performance and Analytics Cookies: These cookies collect information about how you use our Services, such as which pages you visit and if you experience any errors. This helps us improve the performance of our Services and understand how users interact with them. We use third-party analytics providers, such as Google Analytics, to help analyse how users use the site.
3. Functional Cookies: These cookies allow us to remember choices you make when you use our Services, such as remembering your language preferences, remembering your login details, and remembering the changes you make to other parts of our Services which you can customise.
4. Targeting/Advertising Cookies: These cookies are used to make advertising messages more relevant to you and your interests. They also perform functions like preventing the same ad from continuously reappearing, ensuring that ads are properly displayed, and in some cases selecting advertisements that are based on your interests.
5. Social Media Cookies: These cookies are used when you share information using a social media sharing button or "like" button on our Services or you link your account or engage with our content on or through a social media site. The social network will record that you have done this.
6. Other Tracking Technologies: We may also use other tracking technologies such as web beacons (also known as pixel tags or clear GIFs), device fingerprinting, and local storage. These technologies perform similar functions to cookies but operate differently.

**THIRD-PARTY USE OF COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES**
We may allow selected third parties to place cookies through our Services to provide us with better insights into the use of the Services or user demographics or to provide relevant advertising to you. These third parties may collect information about a user's online activities over time and across different websites when they use our Services.
For example, we utilise Google Analytics to analyse usage patterns of our Services. Google Analytics generates statistical and other information about website use by means of cookies, which are stored on users' computers.

**SPECIFIC COOKIE CONTROLS**

1. Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on: To provide website visitors more choice on how their data is collected by Google Analytics, Google has developed an Opt-out Browser add-on, which is available by visiting Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on, to enable you to opt-out of Google's programs.
2. Do Not Track: Some browsers have incorporated "Do Not Track" (DNT) features. Because there is not yet a common understanding of how to interpret the DNT signal, our Services do not currently respond to browser DNT signals.
