6\. DATA SUBJECT RIGHTS

9\. DELETION OR RETURN OF CONTROLLER PERSONAL DATA

9.1 Subject to sections 9.2 and 9.3, the Processor shall promptly and in any event within \[TIME_PERIOD\] of the date of cessation of any Services involving the Processing of Controller Personal Data (the "Cessation Date"), delete and procure the deletion of all copies of those Controller Personal Data.

The Processor shall comply with any such written request within \[TIME_PERIOD\] of the Cessation Date.

9.4 The Processor shall provide written certification to the Controller that it has fully complied with this section 9 within \[TIME_PERIOD\] of the Cessation Date.

10\. AUDIT RIGHTS

10.1 Subject to sections 10.2 to 10.4, the Processor shall make available to the Controller on request all information necessary to demonstrate compliance with this DPA, and shall allow for and contribute to audits, including inspections, by the Controller or an auditor mandated by the Controller in relation to the Processing of the Controller Personal Data by the Processor.

10.2 Information and audit rights of the Controller only arise under section 10.1 to the extent that the Principal Agreement does not otherwise give them information and audit rights meeting the relevant requirements of Data Protection Law (including, where applicable, article 28(3)(h) of the GDPR).

10.3 The Controller shall give the Processor reasonable notice of any audit or inspection to be conducted under section 10.1 and shall make (and ensure that each of its mandated auditors makes) reasonable endeavours to avoid causing (or, if it cannot avoid, to minimise) any damage, injury or disruption to the Processor's premises, equipment, personnel and business while its personnel are on those premises in the course of such an audit or inspection. The Processor need not give access to its premises for the purposes of such an audit or inspection: (a) to any individual unless he or she produces reasonable evidence of identity and authority; (b) outside normal business hours at those premises, unless the audit or inspection needs to be conducted on an emergency basis and the Controller has given notice to the Processor that this is the case before attendance outside those hours begins; or (c) for the purposes of more than \[NUMBER\] audit or inspection in any calendar year, except for any additional audits or inspections which (i) the Controller reasonably considers necessary because of genuine concerns as to the Processor's compliance with this DPA; or (ii) the Controller is required or requested to carry out by Data Protection Law, a Supervisory Authority or any similar regulatory authority responsible for the enforcement of Data Protection Laws in any country or territory, where the Controller has identified its concerns or the relevant requirement or request in its notice to the Processor of the audit or inspection.

10.4 The Processor may object in writing to an auditor appointed by the Controller to conduct any audit under section 10.1 if the auditor is, in the reasonable opinion of the Processor, not suitably qualified or independent, a competitor of the Processor, or otherwise manifestly unsuitable. Any such objection by the Processor will require the Controller to appoint another auditor or conduct the audit itself.

11\. RESTRICTED TRANSFERS

11.1 Subject to section 11.3, the Controller (as "data exporter") and the Processor (as "data importer") hereby enter into the Standard Contractual Clauses in respect of any Restricted Transfer from the Controller to the Processor.

11.2 The Standard Contractual Clauses shall come into effect under section 11.1 on the later of: (a) the data exporter becoming a party to them; (b) the data importer becoming a party to them; and (c) commencement of the relevant Restricted Transfer.

11.3 Section 11.1 shall not apply to a Restricted Transfer unless its effect, together with other reasonably practicable compliance steps (which, for the avoidance of doubt, do not include obtaining consents from Data Subjects), is to allow the relevant Restricted Transfer to take place without breach of applicable Data Protection Law.

12\. GENERAL TERMS

Governing law and jurisdiction

12.1 Without prejudice to clauses 7 (Mediation and Jurisdiction) and 9 (Governing Law) of the Standard Contractual Clauses (a) the parties to this DPA hereby submit to the choice of jurisdiction stipulated in the Principal Agreement with respect to any disputes or claims howsoever arising under this DPA, including disputes regarding its existence, validity or termination or the consequences of its nullity; and (b) this DPA and all non-contractual or other obligations arising out of or in connection with it are governed by the laws of the country or territory stipulated for this purpose in the Principal Agreement.

Order of precedence

12.2 Nothing in this DPA reduces the Processor's obligations under the Principal Agreement in relation to the protection of Personal Data or permits the Processor to Process (or permit the Processing of) Personal Data in a manner which is prohibited by the Principal Agreement. In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between this DPA and the Standard Contractual Clauses, the Standard Contractual Clauses shall prevail.

12.3 Subject to section 12.2, with regard to the subject matter of this DPA, in the event of inconsistencies between the provisions of this DPA and any other agreements between the parties, including the Principal Agreement and including (except where explicitly agreed otherwise in writing, signed on behalf of the parties) agreements entered into or purported to be entered into after the date of this DPA, the provisions of this DPA shall prevail.

Changes in Data Protection Laws, etc.

12.4 The Controller may: (a) by at least \[TIME_PERIOD\] written notice to the Processor, from time to time make any variations to the Standard Contractual Clauses (including any Standard Contractual Clauses entered into under section 11.1), as they apply to Restricted Transfers which are subject to a particular Data Protection Law, which are required, as a result of any change in, or decision of a competent authority under, that Data Protection Law, to allow those Restricted Transfers to be made (or continue to be made) without breach of that Data Protection Law, and (b) propose any other variations to this DPA which the Controller reasonably considers to be necessary to address the requirements of any Data Protection Law.

12.5 If the Controller gives notice under section 12.4(a): (a) the parties shall promptly discuss the proposed variations and negotiate in good faith with a view to agreeing and implementing those or alternative variations designed to address the requirements identified in the Controller's notice as soon as is reasonably practicable; and (b) the Controller shall not unreasonably withhold or delay agreement to any consequential variations to this DPA proposed by the Processor to protect the Processor against additional risks associated with the variations made under section 12.4(a).

12.6 If the Controller gives notice under section 12.4(b), the parties shall promptly discuss the proposed variations and negotiate in good faith with a view to agreeing and implementing those or alternative variations designed to address the requirements identified in the Controller's notice as soon as is reasonably practicable.

12.7 Neither the Controller nor the Processor shall require the consent or approval of any Data Subject to any amendment to this DPA made in accordance with this section 12\.

Severance

12.8 Should any provision of this DPA be invalid or unenforceable, then the remainder of this DPA shall remain valid and in force. The invalid or unenforceable provision shall be either (i) amended as necessary to ensure its validity and enforceability, while preserving the parties' intentions as closely as possible or, if this is not possible, (ii) construed in a manner as if the invalid or unenforceable part had never been contained therein.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, this DPA is entered into and becomes a binding part of the Principal Agreement with effect from the date first set out above.
